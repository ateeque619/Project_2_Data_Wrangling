# Project_2_Data_Wrangling
This is the 2nd project of Data Acquisition and Data Wrangling
In this project data given about Bike rentals, including information like season, weather, temperature etc. This data can be used to understand the factors that influence bike rental demand, such as weather condition, temperature, humidity, and feels like temperature etc. for this one need to clean the data by data wrangling for further usage of data. 

# Learning Outcomes:

# Data Wrangling:
# - Learned how to perform data wrangling tasks such as:
#   - Loading data from CSV files using pandas.
#   - Exploring the dataset using head(), shape, unique(), nunique(), isnull(), info(), and describe().
#   - Extracting year, month, and day from a date column using pandas datetime functions.
#   - Dropping unnecessary columns using drop().
#   - Merging datasets using merge().
#   - Concatenating datasets using concat().
#   - Handling missing values using fillna().
#   - Checking for duplicate rows using duplicated().
#   - Calculating central tendency measures (mean, median, mode).

# Data Cleaning:
# - Learned how to perform data cleaning tasks such as:
#   - Replacing boolean values with 0 and 1.
#   - Handling outliers using IQR and replacing them with median values.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
# - Learned how to perform EDA tasks such as:
#   - Checking for skewness using skew().
#   - Calculating the correlation matrix using corr().
#   - Visualizing the correlation matrix using a heatmap with sns.heatmap().
#   - Interpreting the heatmap to identify correlations between variables.
